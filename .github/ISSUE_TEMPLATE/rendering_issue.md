**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the rendering issue is.

**Attach Raw Source**
The best way for us to debug a rendering issue is to have a copy of the raw message source. If you are willing to share the entire message with us, click the `(…)` menu in the message’s header, click View Raw Source, and from that new window select File > Save to save it as a .eml file.

Please email your .eml file to support@mimestream.com, with a link to the issue you've created. Alternatively, you can attach it here (GitHub will require you to zip it), but note that it will be publicly viewable.

**Screenshots**
Please add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Configuration:**
 - OS: [e.g. macOS Big Sur]
 - Mimestream Version [e.g. v0.6.25]
