**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Logs/Diagnostics**
Please collect logs/diagnostics by running the following script in Terminal:
```
/Applications/Mimestream.app/Contents/Resources/collectDiagnostics.sh
```
Note: Mimestream makes every effort to not log any personal email content, aside from the addresses of the account(s) you have set up in the app, and in the vast majority of cases, this is true. However, because Mimestream uses many frameworks that all log as well, it's not possible for us to provide guarantees about the content of the logs. Please review your logs (and our [privacy policy](https://mimestream.com/privacy)) before sending them in.

Send logs to support@mimestream.com, with a link to your issue as the subject.

**Screenshots**
Please add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Configuration:**
 - OS: [e.g. macOS Big Sur]
 - Mimestream Version [e.g. v0.6.25]
